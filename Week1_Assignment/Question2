Question 2
Search (15 Marks) 
You have a huge data set and it is in unsorted order. Which search do you prefer ? 
Hint : This is a trade off question

If you have a huge dataset that is unsorted, Linear Search is generally preferred because it doesn’t require any preprocessing. 
It simply checks each element one by one until it finds the target or exhausts the dataset, making it a straightforward and direct approach with a 
time complexity of O(n). However, if you were to sort the data first, you could use Binary Search, which is much faster with a time complexity of
O(log n). But sorting itself would take **O(n log n)** time, making it inefficient for a one-time search, especially with large unsorted datasets. 

Thus, if you only need to search once, Linear Search is typically the better choice. However, if you plan to perform multiple searches on the same dataset,
it may make sense to sort the data first and then apply Binary Search for faster subsequent lookups, despite the initial sorting cost.
It’s a trade-off between initial sorting overhead and long-term search efficiency.
